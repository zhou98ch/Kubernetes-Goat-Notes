### How I exploited it step by step
To get started with the scenario, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:1231

It looks like a text input where you can feed in your malicious command. Just write the command after the the IP address, which will be  executed after the "Ping 127.0.0.1", using the dilemeter ";" (in Linux command).
I simply tested it with: 'echo "hello"'. It works.

To execute docker-related commands, I need to know where docker socket is mounted at. I got a little bit hint from this picture in the doc:

Used "ls" in the "custom" directory and found the docker socket in "custom/containerd/containerd.sock".

Now I'm stucked again, so I checked the 2nd hint in the doc: "use the crictl binary to communicate with that with -r flag".

What is crictl?

crictl is a command-line interface for CRI-compatible container runtimes. You can use it to inspect and debug container runtimes and applications on a Kubernetes node. crictl and its source are hosted in the cri-tools repository
